# Alzheimer's Detection using Quantum Machine Learning

This project explores the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.  It investigates the potential of quantum algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Alzheimer's diagnosis compared to classical machine learning methods.

## Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention and management. This project aims to leverage the power of quantum computing to develop more accurate and potentially faster diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's disease.  We explore various QML algorithms and compare their performance with classical machine learning approaches.

## Features

* **Data Preprocessing:**  Includes methods for cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the Alzheimer's disease dataset for both classical and quantum machine learning models. (Specify the dataset used, e.g., ADNI, or describe the data features.)
* **Classical Machine Learning Models:** Implements and evaluates classical machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Neural Networks) as a baseline for comparison.
* **Quantum Machine Learning Models:** Explores and implements quantum machine learning algorithms (e.g., Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs), Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), etc.) for Alzheimer's detection. 
* **Performance Evaluation:**  Compares the performance of classical and quantum models using appropriate metrics.
* **Quantum Simulation:**  Simulates quantum algorithms on classical computers using quantum simulators (Qiskit Aer).
